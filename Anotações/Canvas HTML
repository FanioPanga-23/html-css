The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw(desenhar) graphics on a web page.

The graphic to the left is created with <canvas>. It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.

What is HTML Canvas?

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.

Canvas Examples

A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.

The markup looks like this:
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>

Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.
