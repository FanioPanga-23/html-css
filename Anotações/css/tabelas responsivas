				Responsive Table

A responsive table will display a horizontal scroll bar if the screen is too small to display the full content
				
Add a container element (like <div>) with overflow-x:auto around the <table> element to make it responsive:

Example:

	<div style="overflow-x:auto;">

	<table>
	... table content ...
	</table>

	</div> 	
	
NOTE: In OS X Lion (on Mac), scrollbars are hidden by default and only shown when being used (even though "overflow:scroll" is set).
