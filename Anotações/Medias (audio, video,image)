								VIDEO
								
The HTML <video> Element

To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element:
Example:

	<video width="320" height="240" controls>
	  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>

How it Works

The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.
HTML <video> Autoplay

To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:
Example:

	<video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
	  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>

Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):
Example:
	
	<video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted>
	  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
